Project Title: AssistMe

Team Name: ZASsy

Project Description: 

        Personal Assistant Type App

        Each day, wake up and take a quick survey:
        1 - How do you feel?
        2 - What do you have to do (meetings, work, exercise, other types of activities)
        3 - What's the weather like?

        The app uses APIs to get weather info, music, food suggestions, potential shopping ideas (what you could buy) based on your survey results/interests/weather.

        One-stop shop with coordinated information for you to digest based on YOU that day.

        APIs to be Used - weather(Open Weather Map), music(Spotify API), food(Zomato), location services/geocoding(Google Maps), shopping(researching still), news(NYTimes)

Libraries to use: SVG Icons Library (Vivid.js), jQuery, Bootstrap


BONUS: Place for jokes at the end
